# Welcome to my public repository

This Github repository contains my code experiments in artificial intelligence.

I am a serial tech entrepreneur with MSc in Business Administration. While I have studied information systems and understand code on a basic level, I am in no way a software development professional. But I do have passion for cutting edge technology, and often dig deep into the technical foundation of new technologies.

Sincerely,

**Mikko Alasaarela**
