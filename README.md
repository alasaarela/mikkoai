# Welcome to my public repository

This Github repository contains my code experiments in artificial intelligence.

I am a serial tech entrepreneur with MSc in Business Administration. While I have studied information systems and understand code on a basic level, I am in no way a software development professional. 

Having said that, I do have passion for cutting edge technology, and often dig deep into the technical foundation of new technologies. This repository is dedicated to facilitate my learning and experiments in this space. Feel free to use the code, if you find it useful. Everything here is under the MIT license.

Sincerely,

**Mikko Alasaarela**
